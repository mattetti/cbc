# CBC / Radio Canada backup system

This is a proof of concept for educational purposes.
Given someone located in Canada, how can they backup a recent or broadcast still available online.

Usage example:

```$ go run main.go "https://ici.radio-canada.ca/jeunesse/scolaire/emissions/5462/trullalleri/contenu/videos/accueil"```

A canadian connection is required (local or via VPN).
Episodes are downloaded as mp4 locally.
